Hello fellow readers and welcome to my blog! I have not found a better way to start this blog  than a post that explains how I have set up this. So, I will try to explain the arquitecture I have used, why I have elected to use this and what other alternatives do we have when it comes to having a site on the Internet.

## Introduction

I have decided to follow a modern serverless arquitecture using a static site generator, but why?.. Well, why not?

Static site generators have been with us for more than \[REVISAR ESTO]. They are simple, they have no database, no updates, no mantenances... just your content!

The most important thing when you set up a blog (at least a personal blog) is your content, thats where the effor should go. I wanted to look for the easiest way of starting to publish my content to the word as quick and easy as posible. 

Nevertheless, this option is not for everybody, I consider that at least you need to have a little bit of knowing of what you are doing.
